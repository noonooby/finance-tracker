# Bank Accounts Feature - Test Report & Verification

## Executive Summary

**Status**: ✅ **All Critical Bugs Fixed - Ready for Testing**

All bank accounts implementation phases (1-9) have been completed and verified. Two critical bugs have been fixed:

1. ✅ **Fixed**: Database schema error for `account_number_last4` column
2. ✅ **Fixed**: Improved primary account deletion messaging

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

### Bug 1: account_number_last4 Database Schema Error

**Symptom**: When editing a bank account balance, the system threw error: "could not find account_number_last4 column of bank_accounts in the schema cache"

**Root Cause**: The BankAccounts.js component included an optional "Last 4 Digits" field for account numbers, but this column doesn't exist in the database schema.

**Solution**: Removed all references to `account_number_last4` from:
- `src/components/BankAccounts.js` (lines 63, 121, 137, 183, 607-618, 701)

**Files Modified**:
- [BankAccounts.js](src/components/BankAccounts.js)

**Verification**:
- ✅ Form state no longer includes `account_number_last4`
- ✅ Database save no longer attempts to write this field
- ✅ Display no longer tries to show this field
- ✅ No more database schema errors when editing accounts

---

### Bug 2: Primary Account Deletion Confusion

**Symptom**: User reported "why am I unable to delete the cash in primary account"

**Root Cause**: The primary account cannot be deleted by design (safety feature), but:
1. The error message was unclear about how to reduce the balance to zero
2. Users were confused about the difference between "delete account" vs "remove cash"

**Solution**:
1. Enhanced error message when attempting to delete primary account
2. Provided clear instructions:
   - How to reduce balance to $0: "Click the Edit button and change the balance to $0"
   - How to delete the account: "First set another account as primary, then delete this one"

**Files Modified**:
- [BankAccounts.js:242](src/components/BankAccounts.js#L242)

**Verification**:
- ✅ User can edit primary account and set balance to 0
- ✅ Clear instructions provided for both scenarios
- ✅ Primary account protection remains intact (safety feature)

  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  balance NUMERIC NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  account_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'checking', 'savings', 'investment', 'cash'

);
```
