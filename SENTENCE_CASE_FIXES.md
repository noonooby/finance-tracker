# Sentence Case Fixes - Complete Guide

## üéØ Problem
Activity descriptions and UI text are not consistently following Sentence Case formatting.

**Examples of issues:**
- ‚ùå "Payment for card Rogers Master Card from Cash"
- ‚ùå "Added credit card 'Name' - Frequency onetime"
- ‚ùå "Transferred from Bank Account"
- ‚ùå "Reserved Fund Applied: Rent"

**Should be:**
- ‚úÖ "Payment for 'Rogers Master Card' from cash"
- ‚úÖ "Added credit card 'Name' - Frequency One Time"
- ‚úÖ "Transferred from bank account"
- ‚úÖ "Reserved fund applied: Rent"

## üìã Global Changes Needed

### Rule 1: Descriptions Start with Capital Letter
‚úÖ First word capitalized: "Payment", "Added", "Updated", "Deleted"

### Rule 2: Entity Types are Lowercase (in middle of sentence)
- ‚ùå "Payment for card" 
- ‚úÖ "Payment for 'CardName' from cash"

- ‚ùå "from Reserved Fund"
- ‚úÖ "from reserved fund"

- ‚ùå "from Bank Account"  
- ‚úÖ "from bank account"

- ‚ùå "from Credit Card"
- ‚úÖ "from credit card"

### Rule 3: Frequency Values Must Be Formatted
- ‚ùå `onetime` ‚Üí ‚úÖ `One Time`
- ‚ùå `weekly` ‚Üí ‚úÖ `Weekly`
- ‚ùå `biweekly` ‚Üí ‚úÖ `Bi-Weekly`
- ‚ùå `monthly` ‚Üí ‚úÖ `Monthly`
- ‚ùå `bimonthly` ‚Üí ‚úÖ `Bi-Monthly`

### Rule 4: "from" is Lowercase (middle of sentence)
- ‚ùå "Payment from Cash"
- ‚úÖ "Payment from cash"

## üîß Implementation

### Step 1: Import Helper Function
Add to each component that creates descriptions:

```javascript
import { formatFrequency, formatPaymentSource, buildPaymentDescription } from '../utils/sentenceCase';
```

### Step 2: Fix Payment Descriptions

**CreditCards.js** - Line ~950 (in handlePayment):
```javascript
// OLD:
description: `Payment for card ${card.name}${sourceName ? ` from ${sourceName}` : ''}`

// NEW:
description: `Payment for '${card.name}' from ${sourceName.toLowerCase()}`
```

**And in activity log** - Line ~960:
```javascript
// OLD:
`Made payment of ${formatCurrency(paymentAmount)} for '${card.name}' from ${sourceName} - Balance...`

// NEW:
`Made payment of ${formatCurrency(paymentAmount)} for '${card.name}' from ${sourceName.toLowerCase()} - Balance...`
```

**Loans.js** - Similar changes in handlePayment:
```javascript
// OLD:
description: `Payment for loan ${loan.name}${sourceName ? ` from ${sourceName}` : ''}`

// NEW:
description: `Payment for '${loan.name}' from ${sourceName.toLowerCase()}`
```

### Step 3: Fix Source Names

All places where we set `sourceName`, ensure proper casing:

```javascript
// When setting sourceName from payment methods:

// For cash:
sourceName = 'cash'; // lowercase

// For cash in hand:
sourceName = 'cash in hand'; // lowercase

// For reserved funds:
sourceName = fund.name; // keep as-is (it's a proper noun)

// For bank accounts:
sourceName = account.name; // keep as-is (it's a proper noun)

// For credit cards:
sourceName = card.name; // keep as-is (it's a proper noun)
```

### Step 4: Fix Frequency Display

**In all components that show frequency**, wrap with formatFrequency:

```javascript
// OLD:
{loan.frequency}
<option value="onetime">One-time</option>
Frequency ${fund.frequency}

// NEW:
{formatFrequency(loan.frequency)}
<option value="onetime">One Time</option>
Frequency {formatFrequency(fund.frequency)}
```

### Step 5: Fix Transaction Descriptions

**In db.js** - Reserved fund transaction descriptions:
```javascript
// OLD:
description: `Reserved fund applied: ${fund.name}`

// NEW:  
description: `Reserved fund applied: ${fund.name}`
// (This one is actually correct - starts with capital, entity type is lowercase)
```

**In BankAccounts.js** - Transfer descriptions:
```javascript
// OLD:
description: `Transferred ${formatCurrency(transferResult.amount)} from '${transferResult.fromAccount}' to '${transferResult.toAccount}'...`

// NEW: (This is correct)
description: `Transferred ${formatCurrency(transferResult.amount)} from '${transferResult.fromAccount}' to '${transferResult.toAccount}'...`
```

### Step 6: Fix Activity Logging

**Common patterns to fix:**

```javascript
// OLD:
`Added credit card '${name}' - Balance ${amount} ‚Ä¢ Limit ${limit} ‚Ä¢ Rate ${rate}% ‚Ä¢ Due ${date}`

// KEEP AS-IS - This is correct (starts with capital, property names are fine)

// OLD:
`Frequency ${frequency}`

// NEW:
`Frequency ${formatFrequency(frequency)}`
```

   - Replace raw frequency values with `formatFrequency(value)`
   - Update select option labels

### Priority 4: Add/Edit/Delete Descriptions
7. **All Components**:
   - Check activity log descriptions
   - Ensure entity types are lowercase in middle of sentences
   - Ensure frequencies use formatFrequency()

## üß™ Test Cases

After fixes, verify these outputs:

### Payment Descriptions:
```
‚úÖ "Payment for 'Rogers Master Card' from cash in hand"
‚úÖ "Payment for 'Car Loan' from reserved fund: Rent"
‚úÖ "Payment for 'Visa' from bank account: Tangerine Checking"
```

### Frequency Display:
```
‚úÖ "Frequency One Time"
‚úÖ "Frequency Weekly"
‚úÖ "Frequency Bi-Weekly"
‚úÖ "Frequency Monthly"
```

### Add Descriptions:
```
‚úÖ "Added credit card 'Rogers' - Balance $500 ‚Ä¢ Limit $5000 ‚Ä¢ Rate 19.99% ‚Ä¢ Frequency Monthly"
‚úÖ "Added loan 'Car Loan' - Principal $20000 ‚Ä¢ Balance $18000 ‚Ä¢ Payment $500 Monthly"
‚úÖ "Added reserved fund 'Rent' - Amount $1200 ‚Ä¢ Due 01/01/2025 ‚Ä¢ Frequency Monthly"
```

### Transfer Descriptions:
```
‚úÖ "Transferred $500.00 from 'Checking' to 'Savings' on 10/18/2025"
‚úÖ "Deposited $100.00 from cash in hand to 'Tangerine Checking'"
‚úÖ "Withdrew $50.00 from 'Savings' to cash in hand"
```

## üöÄ Quick Implementation

I'll create specific edit instructions for each file with exact line changes to make this easier.

### Automated Approach:
Import the helper and use it consistently:

```javascript
import { formatFrequency } from '../utils/sentenceCase';

// In descriptions:
`Frequency ${formatFrequency(loan.frequency)}`

// In activity logs:
`Added loan '${name}' - Frequency ${formatFrequency(frequency)}`
```

### Manual Approach:
Search and replace patterns:
- Find: `from Cash`
- Replace: `from cash`

- Find: `from Reserved Fund`
- Replace: `from reserved fund`

- Find: `Payment for card`
- Replace: `Payment for`

- Find: `Payment for loan`
- Replace: `Payment for`
