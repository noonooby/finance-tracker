# ðŸš¨ Emergency Fix - App Not Loading

## Problem
The app has temporal dead zone errors due to function hoisting issues.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Stop the development server
Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal to stop React

### 2. Clear build cache
```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
rm -rf build
```

### 3. Restart the dev server
```bash
npm start
```

### 4. If still broken, revert the problematic changes

Open `/src/App.js` and make these minimal changes:

**A. Keep handleViewChange SIMPLE (around line 707):**
```javascript
const handleViewChange = useCallback((newView) => {
  setCurrentView(newView);
  
  // Just change view - no auto-checks for now
  if (session && loadLatestActivities) {
    loadLatestActivities().catch(err => console.error('Error loading activities:', err));
  }
}, [session, loadLatestActivities]);
```

**B. Remove the useEffect that triggers auto-payments (if it exists)**

**C. Verify displayAvailableCash is AFTER all state declarations:**
```javascript
// This should be around line 720, AFTER handleViewChange
const displayAvailableCash = calculateTotalBankBalance(bankAccounts) + cashInHand;
```

## If Still Broken - Nuclear Option

Replace the entire `handleViewChange` with this ultra-simple version:

```javascript
const handleViewChange = (newView) => {
  setCurrentView(newView);
};
```

And remove ANY calls to `autoPayObligations` or `checkAutoIncome` from the component.

Then manually click "Process Due Payments" button when needed.

## Root Cause

The issue is that functions declared with `useCallback` later in the file are being referenced in dependencies of earlier functions, creating a temporal dead zone.

## Solution

Either:
1. Move all function declarations to the TOP of the component (before any usage)
2. Remove problematic dependencies (what I'm trying to do)
3. Simplify to avoid the complexity entirely
