# 🎯 Gift Card Smart Context System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ What Was Added

### **1. Context Manager (`giftCardOperationsContexts.js`)**
Two specialized context managers that learn and remember:

**Add Balance Context:**
- Last used amount
- Payment source (cash_in_hand/bank_account/credit_card)
- Payment source ID
- Category selection

**Use Balance Context:**
- Last used amount
- Category selection
- Notes pattern

**Additional Features:**
- `getRecentGiftCardAmounts()` - Returns up to 5 most recent unique amounts used

---

## 🎨 Smart Features in Modal

### **1. Auto-Fill Last Used Values**
When you open "Manage Balance":
- ✅ Amount field pre-filled with last used amount
- ✅ Payment source pre-selected (Add Balance)
- ✅ Category pre-selected
- ✅ Notes pre-filled if you used the same pattern before
- ✅ Blue indicator shows "Pre-filled with your last used values"

### **2. Recent Amounts Quick Select**
- ✅ Shows up to 5 recent unique amounts as clickable buttons
- ✅ Icon: TrendingUp (📈)
- ✅ One-click to select a recent amount
- ✅ Highlights selected amount in blue
- ✅ Combines both Add and Use amounts

### **3. Smart Input Math**
- ✅ Type `25+10` → Shows `= $35.00`
- ✅ Type `100/4` → Shows `= $25.00`
- ✅ Type `10*5` → Shows `= $50.00`
- ✅ Green preview text below input
- ✅ Auto-formats to 2 decimals on blur

### **4. Context Persistence**
- ✅ Separate contexts for Add Balance vs Use Balance
- ✅ Context switches when you toggle operation type
- ✅ Always uses today's date (not saved date)
- ✅ Saves context on successful submission

## 🔄 User Flow Examples

### **Example 1: First Time User**
1. Opens modal → Empty form with default category
2. Fills in $50, selects category "Coffee"
3. Submits → Context saved

### **Example 2: Returning User - Add Balance**
1. Opens modal → Auto-fills:
   - Amount: $50.00 (last used)
   - Payment Source: Debit Card (last used)
   - Category: Gift Card Purchase
2. Shows recent amounts: [$50, $25, $100, $20]
3. User clicks $100 button → Amount changes to $100
4. Submits → New context saved

### **Example 3: Returning User - Use Balance**
1. Opens modal → Switches to "Use Balance"
2. Auto-fills:
   - Amount: $5.75 (last coffee purchase)
   - Category: Coffee
   - Notes: "Morning coffee"
3. Shows recent amounts: [$5.75, $12.50, $8.00]
4. User types `5.75+2` → Shows "= $7.75"
5. Submits → Context saved

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### **Database Storage**
Contexts stored in `form_contexts` table:
```sql
{
  context_type: 'gift_card_add_balance',
  keys: { gift_card_id: 'uuid' },
  context_data: {
    amount: 50,
    payment_source: 'bank_account',
    payment_source_id: 'uuid',
    category_id: 'coffee',
    timestamp: '2025-01-15T10:30:00Z'
  }
}
```

### **Key Functions**
```javascript
// Save context after successful submission
await saveGiftCardAddBalanceContext(formData, giftCard);

// Load context when modal opens
const context = await getGiftCardAddBalanceContext(giftCard.id);

// Get recent amounts for quick select
const amounts = await getRecentGiftCardAmounts(giftCard.id, 5);
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Faster Data Entry**: Last values pre-filled automatically
2. **Smart Predictions**: Shows most used amounts as buttons
3. **Math Convenience**: Calculate totals directly in amount field
4. **Reduced Errors**: Consistent categories and sources
5. **Better UX**: Visual feedback with indicators and previews

---

## 🔍 Visual Indicators

**Blue Context Indicator:**
```
📈 Pre-filled with your last used values
```

**Recent Amounts:**
```
📈 Recent amounts:
[$50.00] [$25.00] [$100.00] [$20.00]
```

**Math Preview:**
```
Input: 25+10
Preview: = $35.00 (green text)
```

## ✅ Validation & Error Handling

- ✅ Validates amount > 0
- ✅ Validates category selected
- ✅ Handles context load failures gracefully
- ✅ Falls back to defaults if no context exists
- ✅ Console logs for debugging

---

## 🚀 Performance

- ✅ Loads context asynchronously (non-blocking)
- ✅ Caches recent amounts in component state
- ✅ Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- ✅ Only saves context on successful submission

---

## 📝 Code Quality

- ✅ Follows existing BaseContextManager pattern
- ✅ Consistent with other form contexts (income, expense, etc.)
- ✅ Proper error handling with try-catch
- ✅ TypeScript-ready structure
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns

**All gift card smart context features are fully implemented and production-ready!** 🎉
