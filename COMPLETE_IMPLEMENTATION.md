## 🎨 Visual Improvements Across All Components

3. **Processing**: Text changes to "Processing..." / "Adding..." / "Deleting..." etc.
4. **Complete**: Toast notification appears (top-center)

### Toast Notifications:
- ✅ **Success**: Green, 3 seconds, auto-dismiss

- ✅ **Messages**: Clear, actionable, includes entity names and amounts
