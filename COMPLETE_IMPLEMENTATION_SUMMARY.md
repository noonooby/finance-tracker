## 🎯 **What Each Form Remembers**

### 1. Income Form (Income.js)
**Trigger:** Income source name (e.g., "Salary")  
**Remembers:**
- Deposit destination (bank vs cash in hand)

**User Experience:**
```
User types "Salary" → System remembers:
  ✓ Deposit to Bank Account
  ✓ TD Checking
  ✓ Bi-weekly

User types "Freelance" → System remembers:
  ✓ Keep as Cash in Hand
  ✓ Monthly
```

---

**Trigger:** Expense description (e.g., "Groceries")  
**Remembers:**
- Category

**User Experience:**
```
User types "Groceries" → System remembers:
  ✓ Food category
  ✓ TD Checking account

User types "Gas" → System remembers:
  ✓ Transportation category
  ✓ Rogers Mastercard
```

---

### 3. Credit Card Payments (CreditCards.js)
**Trigger:** Card being paid (e.g., "Visa Card")  
**Remembers:**
- Payment source (cash/bank/reserved fund)

**User Experience:**
```
User opens payment for "Visa Card" → System remembers:
  ✓ Pay from TD Checking
  ✓ Full balance mode

  ✓ Full balance mode
```

### 4. Loan Payments (Loans.js)
**Trigger:** Loan being paid (e.g., "Car Loan")  
**Remembers:**
- Payment source (cash/bank/reserved fund/credit card)
- Payment source ID (which specific source)
- Amount mode (recommended payment vs custom)

**User Experience:**
```
User opens payment for "Car Loan" → System remembers:

## 🎨 **UI Enhancements**

### Quick-Select Buttons (Income & Expenses)
- Show last 5 used items
- Star (⭐) indicator for items used 10+ times
- Active button highlighted in blue
- Buttons wrap nicely on mobile

### Auto-Fill Behavior
- All related fields populate automatically
- Pre-filled text is highlighted for easy override
- Focus moves to next empty field
- Smooth, no-flash transitions

### Context Intelligence
- Each trigger value has independent memory
- "Salary" and "Freelance" remember different settings
- "Groceries" and "Gas" have different categories
- "Visa Card" and "Mastercard" remember different payment sources

## 🔍 **How to Verify Context Data**

### View Saved Contexts in Supabase

**Income Contexts:**
```sql
SELECT 
  source_name,
  destination,
  frequency,
  usage_count,
  last_used_at
FROM income_source_contexts
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY usage_count DESC;
```

**Expense Contexts:**
```sql
SELECT 
  description,
  category_id,
  payment_method,
  usage_count,
  last_used_at
FROM expense_description_contexts
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY usage_count DESC;
```

**Card Payment Contexts:**
```sql
SELECT 
  card_id,
  payment_source,
  payment_source_id,
  amount_mode,
  usage_count,
  last_used_at
FROM card_payment_contexts
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY last_used_at DESC;
```

**Loan Payment Contexts:**
```sql
SELECT 
  loan_id,
  payment_source,
  payment_source_id,
  amount_mode,
  usage_count,
  last_used_at
FROM loan_payment_contexts
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY last_used_at DESC;
```

## 💾 **Database Schema Summary**

All tables follow the same pattern:

### Common Columns (All Tables)
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `user_id` - UUID reference to auth.users
- `usage_count` - Tracks how many times used
- `last_used_at` - When last used (for sorting)
- `created_at` - When context first created
- `updated_at` - When context last updated
- `metadata` - JSONB for future extensions

### Table-Specific Columns

**income_source_contexts:**
- `source_name` - TEXT (trigger: "Salary", "Freelance")
- `destination` - TEXT ('bank' or 'cash_in_hand')
- `account_id` - TEXT (which bank account)
- `frequency` - TEXT ('weekly', 'biweekly', 'monthly', 'onetime')

**expense_description_contexts:**
- `description` - TEXT (trigger: "Groceries", "Gas")
- `category_id` - TEXT (which category)
- `payment_method` - TEXT ('bank_account', 'credit_card', 'cash_in_hand')
- `payment_method_id` - TEXT (which specific payment method)

**card_payment_contexts:**
- `card_id` - TEXT (trigger: which card being paid)
- `payment_source` - TEXT ('bank_account', 'reserved_fund', 'cash_in_hand')
- `payment_source_id` - TEXT (which specific source)
- `amount_mode` - TEXT ('full_balance' or 'custom')

**loan_payment_contexts:**
- `loan_id` - TEXT (trigger: which loan being paid)
- `payment_source` - TEXT ('bank_account', 'reserved_fund', 'credit_card', 'cash_in_hand')
- `payment_source_id` - TEXT (which specific source)
- `amount_mode` - TEXT ('full_payment' or 'custom')

## 🎊 **Success Metrics**

✅ **4 forms enhanced** with context learning  
✅ **8 utility files** created  
✅ **4 database tables** deployed

✅ **Zero errors** in implementation  
✅ **100% non-blocking** - failures never stop main operations  
✅ **Fully tested** Income form  

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### If contexts aren't saving:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database migration ran successfully
3. Check RLS policies are active
4. Ensure user is authenticated

### If contexts aren't loading:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify context data exists in database
3. Check trigger values match exactly (case-sensitive)

### If auto-highlight isn't working:
1. Increase timing delay from 100ms to 150ms
2. Check that ref is properly attached to input
